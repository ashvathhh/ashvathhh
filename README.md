# Hi, I'm Ashvath

I'm a software developer interested in machine learning, computer vision, and building practical tools that solve real problems. A lot of my recent work focuses on human detection in low-visibility environments and connecting AI models to mobile apps.

Graduate student at Northeastern University (MS in AI)  
Looking for Summer 2025 internships  
Boston, MA

## What I'm working on

- YOLOv8-based human detection system designed for smoke/fire environments  
- Flutter mobile app that displays real-time detection output  
- Implementing AI search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, IDS)  
- Reinforcement learning and MDP environments

## Selected Projects

### Human Detection in Low Visibility (YOLOv8)
Computer vision model trained to identify humans in smoky or low-light conditions.  
**Focus areas:** data collection, custom training, model evaluation, real-world constraints

### Emergency Detection Mobile App (Flutter)
Companion app that runs alongside the detection model and shows bounding boxes, alerts, and detection confidence

### Search Algorithms & MDP Simulations
Implementations of common search strategies and Q-learning experiments as part of my AI coursework
