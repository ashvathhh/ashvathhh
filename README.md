# Hi, I'm Ashvath

I'm a software developer interested in machine learning, computer vision, and building practical tools that solve real problems. A lot of my recent work focuses on human detection in low-visibility environments and connecting AI models to mobile apps.

I'm currently an incoming graduate student at Northeastern University and looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2025.

## What I’m working on
- A YOLOv8-based human detection system designed for smoke/fire environments  
- A Flutter mobile app that displays real-time detection output  
- Implementing and understanding AI search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, IDS)  
- Reinforcement learning and simple MDP environments

## Skills
**Languages:** Python, Java, C++, Dart  
**Tools & Frameworks:** Flutter, PyTorch, OpenCV, Git, VS Code  
**Interests:** Computer vision, applied ML, mobile development, AI safety/ethics

## Selected Projects
### Human Detection in Low Visibility (YOLOv8)
Computer vision model trained to identify humans in smoky or low-light conditions.  
**Focus areas:** data collection, custom training, model evaluation, real-world constraints.

### Emergency Detection Mobile App (Flutter)
Companion app that runs alongside the detection model and shows bounding boxes, alerts, and detection confidence.

### Search Algorithms & MDP Simulations
Implementations of common search strategies and Q-learning experiments as part of my AI coursework.
