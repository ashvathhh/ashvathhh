# Hi, I'm Ashvath

I'm a software developer interested in machine learning, computer vision and building practical tools that solve real problems. A lot of my recent work focuses on human detection in low-visibility environments and connecting AI models to mobile apps.

---

## What I'm working on

- Geospatial building orientation detection system processing 11M+ building footprints
- YOLOv8-based human detection system for fire evacuation scenarios
- Implementing AI search algorithms and reinforcement learning environments


## Skills

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, R  
**ML/AI:** PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, YOLOv8  
**Tools:** Pandas, Shapely, Git  
**Databases:** MySQL


## Selected Projects

### Geospatial Building Orientation Detection System
Built Python pipeline using Shapely and R-tree indexing to process 11M+ building footprints with 95% coverage for CA/TX addresses. Achieved 95% memory reduction and sub-second query times through spatial indexing.

### Intelligent Human Detection System For Fire Evacuation (YOLOv8)
Fine-tuned YOLOv8 on custom thermal imaging dataset achieving 89.6% mAP50 and 86.7% precision for human detection in low-visibility fire scenarios. Developed Flutter mobile application with video processing pipeline.

### AI-Optimized Energy Consumption Forecasting System
Developed ML regression model on 1M+ consumption records achieving 0.038 kWh MAE (95% improvement) for real-time energy forecasting and grid optimization.


## Experience

**AI Intern** @ Skillible (July 2024 – August 2024)  
Conducted analysis of bias mitigation strategies in Generative AI systems and developed advanced prompt engineering techniques for LLMs.

**Web Development Intern** @ Anugraha Systems (Jan 2023)  
Developed end-to-end web applications using full stack technologies.
